# Platinum IronMON - GIGA Patch Updates
A list of the updates I have made to the IronMON patch for Pokémon Platinum.<br><br>A big thanks to PyroMike for all his help and Arex for initially making the first changes. Many thanks to Toxxxyn for his help and support when I was streaming the patch development in my Discord server. Lastly, a big thanks to all the streamers who helped me test the early release of the first patch. We had two people win with it!!
<br><br>
I have added snow falling in Twinleaf town (because it's a vibe) but this does technically give an IronMON runner a slight advantage if the fishing pivot has Magic Guard, Ice Body or Snow Cloak.<br>As there might be some controversy over whether this should be included, I have created a snowy version **AND** a clean version. The version with snow included will be specified at the start of the file name in the releases as **"snowy"**.
<br><br>
Furthermore, I have included two versions of each patch- one with the Frame Limiter on and one with the Frame Limiter off. The patch with the file name **"FLX"** has the Frame Limiter turned off (fast).

## Updates:
| **Update** | **Details** | **Added?** |
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| **Dialogue Overhaul** | A lot of unnecessary text has been removed from the game to speed up the run. Less yapping, more battling. Now including all the way up to the Hall of Fame! | ✅ |
| **Move Mom To The Left** | One of the most requested updates is finally here! No more running into the TV! | ✅ |
| **Move NPCs** | Some non-important NPCs have been moved out of the way/ made static to avoid unnecessary bumping into them. Moved some important NPCs closer to doors to avoid chasing them around, such as the Berry lady in Floaroma. | ✅ |
| **Removed/ Moved Signs** | There's a lot of useless signage in Platinum... I have got rid of/ moved a lot of them. | ✅ |
| **Scrapped Arceus Plate Text** | Arceus Plate text will now no longer appear when picking one up. | ✅ |
| **Missing Psyduck** | Added a name-rater Psyduck in the Floaroma PC. | ✅ |
| **Instant Honey Encounters** | Making Honey Pivots more viable. No more waiting for 6 hours for a Pokémon to appear! Apply honey to the tree and see what you find.<br>**Highest encounter level is 23**. | ✅ |
| **Fixed Rival 2 Bug** | Previous versions of the Platinum IronMON patch made it so that the player can battle Barry to the east of Jubilife **BEFORE** talking to him in the trainer school. This breaks the flow of the vanilla game, as Looker should send you to the school before heading onto Route 203. This gives the player more options to pivot than they should have before clearing vital story progression. | ✅ |
| **Fashion IronMON** | The Fashion Case will be fully stocked for your contests. | ✅ |
| **Tuckkable Beds** | The bed in the players' bedroom and the bed in the house outside Eterna forest will now fully heal your party. | ✅ |
| **Time-based Trainers** | Standardised Joggers, Policemen and the Seven Stars Restaurant to battle at any time of the day. | ✅ |
| **Fixed 201 Potion NPC Bug** | The NPC who gives you a free Potion, when talked to twice, would occasionally crash the game. I have removed this NPC after talking to them once. | ✅ |
| **Fixed Dex Acquisition Bug** | When talking to Dawn/Lucas in Sandgem, the game would crash if spamming buttons while still in the "pushed back" walk animation. I have fixed this so it cannot happen. | ✅ |
| **Fixed Bike Shop Crash Bug** | When talking to the NPC who gives you the Bicycle a second time would crash the game. I have removed this NPC after talking to them once. | ✅ |
| **Friendship NPC Uncapped** | Uncapped the previous 1 evolution limit on the friendship NPC in Sandgem. Only works on the first Pokémon in the party. Will not increase friendship for Pokémon who do not require it to evolve. | ✅ |
