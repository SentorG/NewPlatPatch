# Platinum IronMON - Patch Updates
A list of the updates I have made to the IronMON patch for Pokémon Platinum.<br>It is mainly aimed at Ultimate/Kaizo/Survival/Super Kaizo runners.<br>A big thanks to PyroMike for all his help and Arex for initially making the first changes. Many thanks to Toxxxyn for his help and support when I was streaming the patch development in my Discord server. Lastly, a big thanks to all the streamers who helped me test the early release of the patch. We had two people win with it!!

## Updates:
| **Update** | **Details** | **Added?** |
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| **Dialogue Overhaul** | A lot of unnecessary text has been removed from the game to speed up the run. Less yapping, more battling. Now including all the way up to the Hall of Fame! | ✅ |
| **Move Mom To The Left** | One of the most requested updates is finally here! No more running into the TV! | ✅ |
| **Move NPCs** | Some non-important NPCs have been moved out of the way/ made static to avoid unnecessary bumping into them. Moved some important NPCs closer to doors to avoid chasing them around, such as the Berry lady in Floaroma. | ✅ |
| **Removed/ Moved Signs** | There's a lot of useless signage in Platinum... I have got rid of/ moved a lot of them. | ✅ |
| **Scrap Arceus Plate Text** | No more yapping when picking up a Plate! | ✅ |
| **Missing Psyduck** | Added a name-rater Psyduck in the Floaroma PC. | ✅ |
| **Instant Honey Encounters** | Making Honey Pivots more viable. No more waiting! Apply the honey to the tree and see what you find!<br>**Highest encounter level is 23**. | ✅ |
| **Fixed Rival 2 Bug** | Previous versions of the Platinum IronMON patch made it so that the player can battle Barry to the east of Jubilife **BEFORE** talking to him in the trainer school. This breaks the flow of the vanilla game, as Looker should send you to the school before heading onto Route 203. This gives the player more options to pivot than they should have before clearing vital story progression. | ✅ |
| **Fashion IronMON** | The Fashion Case will be fully stocked for your contests. | ✅ |
| **Tuckkable Beds** | Fully heal your party in bed! | ✅ |
| **Time-based Trainers** | Standardised Joggers, Policemen and the Seven Stars Restaurant to battle at any time of the day. | ✅ |
| **Marsh Area NPC** | The Marsh Area has an awkward pool of Pokémon for pivoting in Super Kaizo. I have added an NPC in the foyer to manipulate the time without having to touch the emulator settings.<br>**COMING IN A FUTURE UPDATE**. |  |
| **Illegal Healing Removed** | Removed the healing interactions with the beds in the Veilstone Galactic HQ (apart from one in the left-side bed), meaning the item is very safe to pick up. | ✅ |
| **Illegal Areas Blocked** | Removed/ blocked the warps leading to illegal areas, such as the various caves you cannot enter in Mt. Coronet. | ✅ |
